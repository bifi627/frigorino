## Expiry notifications not visible while the app is in the foreground

Reported during testing: when the PWA is open and focused, an incoming expiry
notification does not appear. Needs verification with a **real** data-only FCM
message before fixing — the foreground `onMessage` handler reads `payload.data.*`,
so a *notification*-type message (e.g. one sent from the Firebase console test UI)
is silently ignored, which may fully explain the report. Even for real messages,
some browsers/OSes suppress a system notification raised while its own tab is
focused. Likely fix if confirmed: surface foreground messages as an in-app toast
(sonner) with a "View" deep-link action, keeping the service-worker
`showNotification` for the background path.

Deferred from the expiry-notifications feature work (testing feedback item #4).
