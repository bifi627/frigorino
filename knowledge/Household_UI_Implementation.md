We've successfully implemented a complete household management UI with mobile-first design:

## ðŸš€ Integration with WelcomePage

The `WelcomePage` now includes:

- **Household Selector** at the top for context switching
- **Create Household** navigation via router
- **Kitchen Overview** stats (ready for real data)
- **Responsive Design** maintaining mobile-first approach

## ðŸŽ¯ User Experience Flow

### **New User Experience**:

1. User logs in and sees WelcomePage
2. HouseholdSelector shows "No Households Yet" message
3. Click "Create Household" button
4. Navigate to `/household/create` route
5. Fill form and submit
6. Automatically set as active household
7. Return to dashboard with household context

### **Existing User Experience**:

1. User sees current household in selector
2. Can click dropdown to see all households
3. Switch between households instantly
4. Create new households anytime
5. Role-based UI shows permissions clearly

## ðŸŽ¨ Design System Consistency

**Color Palette**:

- **Primary Blue** (#2196F3) - Kitchen/inventory items

- **Success Green** (#4CAF50) - Recipes and positive actions
- **Error Red** (#9C27B0/#F44336) - Owner role and alerts
- **Gradients** - Purple/blue gradients for highlight cards

**Typography**:

- **Headers**: Bold, large fonts for clear hierarchy
- **Body Text**: Readable sizes with proper line height
- **Captions**: Smaller text for metadata and helper text
- **Responsive**: Font sizes scale down on mobile

**Component Patterns**:

- **Cards**: Rounded corners (borderRadius: 2-3)
- **Buttons**: Prominent with icons and loading states
- **Forms**: Helper text, validation, and proper spacing
- **Lists**: Clean separation with hover effects
- **Loading**: Consistent spinner patterns

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

**Route Structure**:
