# Ideas

Running list of features and improvements we'd like to explore but don't *have* to do. Distinct in intent from `TECH_DEBT.md` — that file holds known issues we consciously deferred; this one holds forward-looking enhancements that came up while working on something else.

Format per item:
- **Title** — one-line hook.
- **Why:** the motivation / user need it serves.
- **Sketch:** rough implementation outline (not exhaustive — a future planning conversation will detail it).
- **Impact / cost:** what changes, rough size.

## Persist last-active-household per user

- **Why:** Today the active household lives only in `HttpContext.Session` (in-memory cache, browser-session cookie, 30-min idle timeout). When the user closes their browser or the server restarts, the selection is lost and the system silently falls back to the highest-role / earliest-joined household — *not* what the user last picked. For users who live in a non-default household (e.g. a Member household used more often than an Owner one), this is a daily annoyance.
- **Sketch:**
  - Add nullable column `User.LastActiveHouseholdId` (FK Households, ON DELETE SET NULL).
  - Update `CurrentHouseholdService.SetCurrentHouseholdAsync` to write both the session cache and the user column.
  - Update `CurrentHouseholdService.GetCurrentHouseholdIdAsync` lookup order: session → `User.LastActiveHouseholdId` (verify access still valid) → role-based default. Each fallback rehydrates the session.
  - Migration to add the column, no data backfill needed (NULL is fine for existing users).
- **Impact / cost:** ~1 EF migration, ~15 LOC service change, no API surface change, no frontend change. Integration test for "selection survives backend restart" would be valuable but requires Testcontainers restart support — secondary.

## Lightweight CQRS: query repositories + domain repositories

- **Why:** Read and write paths have different shapes but currently share `ApplicationDbContext` directly inside slices. Reads need cheap, per-feature projections to read models (no change tracking, no aggregate loading). Writes need rich domain objects that enforce invariants (`Household.Create`, future `Household.Update`, etc.) and a single `SaveChangesAsync` per slice. Splitting them lets each path stay sharp: query repos for reads, domain repos for writes. Explicitly **no MediatR** — the slice handler stays inline; we just move the EF query out of it.
- **Sketch:**
  - **Query side:** `IHouseholdQueries` in `Frigorino.Domain.Interfaces`, implementation in `Frigorino.Infrastructure.Queries.HouseholdQueries`. Methods return read models (e.g. `Task<IReadOnlyList<HouseholdListItem>>`) and use `.AsNoTracking().Select(...)` for projection. Read models live in a new `Frigorino.Domain.ReadModels` namespace (avoids the Infrastructure → Features circular reference). Slice's `Handle` injects `IHouseholdQueries` instead of `ApplicationDbContext`.
  - **Write side:** `IHouseholdRepository` in `Frigorino.Domain.Interfaces`, implementation in `Frigorino.Infrastructure.Repositories.HouseholdRepository`. Methods load aggregates (`Task<Household?> GetByIdAsync(int, ct)` with the right `Include` chain for the use case), and a `SaveChangesAsync` passthrough — or just expose the aggregate and let the slice call `db.SaveChangesAsync(ct)` once at the end (still need to think this through). `Household.Create()` / future `Household.Update()` stay on the entity.
  - **Slice rule update:** `CreateHousehold.cs:1-13` header rules + `knowledge/Vertical_Slices.md` get a new bullet: "Reads consume `IXxxQueries`. Writes consume `IXxxRepository` and call `SaveChangesAsync` once."
  - **Read model vs response DTO:** open question — collapse them (read model IS the response DTO, lives in the slice file or a shared `XxxResponse.cs`) or separate them (read model in Domain, response in Features). Collapsing is simpler; separating gives stricter Domain isolation. Lean toward collapsing initially, split only if a real reason emerges.
  - **Migration path:** introduce the pattern with one read slice as the first adopter (e.g. the next read slice after `GetUserHouseholds` — `GetHousehold` is a natural candidate since it has the rich shape that needs a real read model). Don't retroactively rewrite already-migrated slices unless touching them for unrelated reasons.
- **Impact / cost:** small per-slice (one new interface + one new query class), large in aggregate when applied across all reads. New project structure decisions (`Frigorino.Domain.ReadModels`?). Doc updates to `Vertical_Slices.md` and the `CreateHousehold.cs` header. Existing `CreateHousehold.cs` stays as-is — the write side already uses the entity factory + DbContext pattern that this idea endorses.
